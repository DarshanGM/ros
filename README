This repository contains the work for implementing a car-like model in gazebo, using ROS.

It assumes that ROS and Gazebo has been installed.

The current model involves testing of the controller using Stage.
We check if the messages can be broadcasted as planned, to the required topics.
Additional information in in vehicle_model.cc

To run a simple simulation, 

$   WORLD=learn roslaunch art_run key_stage.launch
