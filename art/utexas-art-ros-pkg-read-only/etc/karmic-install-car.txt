Installing and configuring Ubuntu Karmic (64-bit) on the car:


TODO:

* fix simulator_art on Karmic

* fix libQGLViewer 64-bit build for dingo


OPTIONAL:

* install stage? (maybe better not, because of ROS)


DONE:

* apt-get install:

  git-core
  libqt4-dev
  ros-boxtutle-base
  ros-boxtutle-image-transport-plugins
  scons

* svn co and build:

  utexas-art-ros-pkg
  sandbox
  camera_drivers_experimental
  dingo
  player-2.12

* get camera permissions working, added this to 60-art-udev.rules

  KERNEL=="raw1394", GROUP="video"

* add robot to video group

* need more ttyS* entries. set this in /etc/default/grub:

  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="8250.nr_uarts=8"

* UDEV symlinks not being set.

  change KERNEL= syntax to KERNEL== in 60-art-udev.rules

* eliminate "error: biosdisk read" on boot

  Ubuntu Bug #396564 for grub2
  Workaround: disable (nonexistent) floppy drive in BIOS
  (speeds up the boot slightly)

* set ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS to -j4

* figure out how to rotate camera images 180 degrees

  Don did it mechanically

* roslaunch art_run drive_pilot.launch

* get cameras working under ROS

  Had to install libraw1394-dev package to eliminate libdc1394v2
  segfault.
